# Description

This is actually the first project I have done, as an assignment for DS101: Introduction to Python Programming course by Hackwagon. This was the first course I have attended since I started learning python. The project focuses on visualising data from the csv titled 'airbnb_data', using the matplotlib library. I have created functions to obtain all longitudes and latitudes of a list of airbnb listings, recommend listings for buyers, recommmend prices for sellers, and to visualise listings (after filtering to the buyers preference) geographically on the actual Singapore map.
